# NetMapper
Purpose: Program I made when I had to deal with accessing a lot of network devices in a lab environment. I always hated looking back to see location information and going to separate applications to access the devices. Made an AiO application that shows me device location in the lab as well as allows accessing the devices (by double clicking).
